This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to the 'error' function. The 'error' function, while useful for signaling issues, can cause unexpected program termination if not used carefully within nested function calls or loops. The bug.m file contains code that might trigger this problem. The bugSolution.m provides a possible solution by using try-catch blocks for robust error handling.
